## Mathematics Developers Survey (a Bayesian approach)

Anonymised responses from Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey are published each year along the results to encourage their further analysis. Being curious about where in the world and in which domain a data scientist should start his / her career, we attempt to answer some of the relevant questions by analysing the available dataset.

#### Important
An important thing to note when interpreting the results however is that this data may not be a represantative sample from the population of mathematics developers. One should keep in mind that these are developers who were aware of the survey and were willing to answer the questions.

The final report of the 2016 survey can be seen [here](2016/report/report.pdf).
