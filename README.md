## Mathematics Developers Survey (a Bayesian approach)

Anonymised responses from Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey are published each year along the results to encourage their further analysis. Being curious about where in the world an aspiring data scientist should start his/her career, I have decided to use the shared data in an attempt to answer this question and to learn more about people identifying themselves as mathematics developers.

The final report of the 2016 survey can be seen [here](2016/report/report.pdf).
